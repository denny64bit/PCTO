    <h2>Titolo</h2>
    <div class="testo">PayPal was born in December 1998 in a company called Confinity. PayPal was actually developed and
        launched on the market as a money transfer service only in 1999, founded by John Malloy of BlueRun Ventures. In
        March 2000, Confinity merged with X.com, an online banking company founded by Elon Musk.
        Online invoicing through PayPal offers convenience by streamlining the management of commercial transactions. It
        provides a user-friendly platform for creating and sending invoices, reducing the paperwork involved in
        traditional methods. Additionally, businesses can easily track payments, set up recurring invoices, and offer
        various payment options, enhancing flexibility for clients. The integration of PayPal also ensures secure and
        swift transactions, contributing to a seamless invoicing process for both businesses and their customers.
        The PayPal app offers a wide range of features that make financial transactions more convenient and efficient.
        In addition to scanning QR codes for instant payments, the app also allows for transaction management, including
        expense tracking and history. You can easily transfer money between PayPal accounts, receive real-time
        notifications on transactions, and utilize multi-currency support to make payments in different currencies
        seamlessly. All of this is done through an intuitive interface designed to streamline the financial management
        process.
